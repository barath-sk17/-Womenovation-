                <p style="font-size:20px;">Everyone are taught about physical health and well-being, but not the mental state
                    of our body. Every day, numerous women are stalked or publicly harassed in this
                    world.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">And, they are still bound to go through this as a part of their day to day life. More or
                    less becoming a part of their life.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">
                    As the fear of being stereotyped, most of these women even fear to lodge a police
                    complaint and just carry on as if nothing had happened. Though women have
                    excelled in various fields, they still go through these and there is no still a standalone
                    solution to solve the mental harassment.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">A solution of visiting psychiatrist is present, but not a lot of women are opting on it,
                    due to the instilled fear of being stereotyped and targeted.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:20px;">Thus, here womenâ€™s complaints would remain anonymous and no one would have
                    the knowledge of her trauma being shared, only if she exists her doctors and
                    medicos who would be assisting her in getting cured.
                </p>
